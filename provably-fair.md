# Provably Fair System at SkinRave

At SkinRave, all CS2 case openings use a provably fair algorithm. Each roll generates a unique hash that users can verify to ensure fairness. This means that no outcome is predetermined and all skin drops are transparent.

## How it works
1. Each case opening generates a random hash.
2. The hash determines the item drop.
3. Users can verify the hash to confirm legitimacy.

Provably fair systems protect users and increase trust, setting SkinRave apart from other case opening platforms.
